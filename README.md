# Access control in JavaScript*

## Introduction

This access control system application is part of a series of how-to Intel® Internet of Things (IoT) code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, Intel® Edison development platform, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:<br>
- Connect the Intel® Edison development platform, a computing platform designed for prototyping and producing IoT and wearable computing products.<br>
- Interface with the Intel® Edison platform IO and sensor repository using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.<br>
- Run this code sample in Intel® XDK IoT Edition, an IDE for creating applications that interact with sensors and actuators, enabling a quick start for developing software for the Intel® Edison board or from the Intel® Galileo board.<br>
- Set up a web application server to let users enter the access code to disable the alarm system and store this alarm data using Azure Redis Cache\* from Microsoft Azure\*, Redis Store\* from IBM\* Bluemix\*, or ElastiCache\* using Redis\* from Amazon\* Web Services\* (AWS\*), different cloud services for connecting IoT solutions including data analysis, machine learning, and a variety of productivity tools to simplify the process of connecting your sensors to the cloud and getting your IoT project up and running quickly.
- Set up a MQTT-based server using IoT Hub\* from Microsoft Azure\*, IoT\* from IBM Bluemix\*, or IoT\* from Amazon Web Services\* (AWS), different cloud machine to machine messaging services based on the industry standard MQTT protocol.


## What it is

Using an Intel® Edison board, this project lets you create a smart access control system that:<br>
- monitors a motion sensor to detect when a person is in an area that requires authorization.<br>
- can be accessed with your mobile phone via the built-in web interface to disable the alarm.<br>
- keeps track of access, using cloud-based data storage.

## How it works

This access control system provides the following user flow:

1. Passive infrared (PIR) motion sensor looks for motion.
2. User sets off the motion detector and has 30 seconds to enter the correct code in the browser.
3. If the user fails to enter the code in the given time, the alarm goes off.
4. If the user enters the correct code, the system waits for 30 seconds before allowing the user to pass.

Additionally, various events (`looking-for-motion`, `motion-detected`, `invalid-code`, etc.) are logged.

Optionally, all data can be stored using the Intel® IoT Examples data store or an MQTT server running in your own Microsoft Azure*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\* account.

    $ git clone https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples.git

Navigate to the directory with this example.

To install Git* on the Intel® Edison board (if you don’t have it yet), establish an SSH connection to the board and run the following command:

    $ opkg install git

### Connecting the Grove* sensors

![](./../../images/js/access-control.jpg)

You need to have a Grove* Shield connected to an Arduino*-compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove devices into the Grove Shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove Shield set to **5V**.

1. Plug one end of a Grove cable into the Grove PIR Motion Sensor, and connect the other end to the D4 port on the Grove Shield.

2. Plug one end of a Grove cable into the Grove RGB LCD, and connect the other end to any of the I2C ports on the Grove Shield.

### Manual Intel® Edison board setup

If you're running this code on your Intel® Edison board manually, you need to install some dependencies.

To obtain the Node.js* modules needed for this example to execute on the Intel® Edison board, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

### Microsoft Azure* server setup

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a back-end database deployed using Microsoft Azure*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

You will see output similar to the above when the program is running.

## Running the program manually

To run the example manually on the Intel® Edison board, establish an SSH connection to the board and execute the following command:

    node index.js

### Disabling the alarm

![](./../../images/js/access-control-web.png)

The alarm is disabled using a single-page web interface served directly from the Intel® Edison board while the sample program is running.

The web server runs on port `3000`, so if Intel® Edison is connected to Wi-Fi* on `192.168.1.13`, the address to browse to if you are on the same network is `http://192.168.1.13:3000`.

### Determining the Intel® Edison board's IP address

You can determine what IP address the Intel® Edison board is connected to by running the following command:

    ip addr show | grep wlan

You will see output similar to the following:

    3: wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 1000
        inet 192.168.1.13/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global wlan0

The IP address is shown next to `inet`. In the example above, the IP address is `192.168.1.13`.
